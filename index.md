## Zachery Sheley

Welcome to my website! If you look hard enough you might just find something worth your while!

### About Me

So you don't die of boredom I'll skip over the parts of the intro that really don't matter.

Hello, yada yada just call me Zach. Somethin' somethin' senior yada yada Maggie L. Walker Governor's School. More boring words galavanting waka waka woods, blah blah blah working blah surveying crew, even more unnecessary words video games.

### So, why are you here?

Well... any number of reasons I guess. Chances are I gave you my site link to checkout some pictures or maybe to download my resume. Who knows maybe you're some sort of 
crazy Russian hacker trying to steal my data. In which case I recommend calling up Mr. Zuck, I'm sure he's running a sale! Whatever the case, you're here; might as well enjoy your stay however brief it is!

### Things YOU Should Know

- I really like using commas, even if I end up using them wrong.
- I like to hide things on my sites. Keep an eye out!
- I'm only temporarily using this Jekyll theme. I'm in the process of moving site pages around and I needed something easy as a placeholder.
- Assume any info submitted to this page and sub pages is not secure. Ya never know. It's always better to be safe than sorry.
